This example requires Tensorflow Object Detection API setup already.  
https://github.com/tensorflow/models

This example serves as a very basic application to quick test the Tensorflow Object API setup.  If everything is done correctly, run the below command will detect objects with a given picture.

This example already include COCO-trained model ssdlite_mobilenet_v2_coco.  Users can interchange it with other models to evaluate results.
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md

Steps to use the example:
1. save a interesting picture as image name test_orig.jpg
2. python3 detect_single_image.py
3. view resulting pic test_result.jpg with bounding boxes of detected objects
